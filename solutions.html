<div id="answers-container">
    <div id="answer1" class="answer" style="display: none;">Pipelining is a technique where multiple instructions are overlapped during execution.</div>
    <div id="answer2" class="answer" style="display: none;">Cache memory is a small, fast memory between CPU and RAM to speed up data access.</div>
    <div id="answer3" class="answer" style="display: none;">RISC uses a small set of simple instructions; CISC uses complex instructions.</div>
    <div id="answer4" class="answer" style="display: none;">A list is an ordered collection of items in Python.</div>
    <div id="answer5" class="answer" style="display: none;">Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.</div>
    <div id="answer6" class="answer" style="display: none;">A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs in Python.</div>
    <div id="answer7" class="answer" style="display: none;">A process is an independent program in execution with its own memory, while 
        a thread is a lightweight part of a process that shares the same memory.</div>
    <div id="answer8" class="answer" style="display: none;">Deadlock is a condition where processes are stuck waiting for resources held by 
        each other; it can be prevented by avoiding circular wait,using resources ordering, or applying safe state algorithms like Banker's algorithm. </div>
    <div id="answer9" class="answer" style="display: none;">Virtual memory is a technique where secondary storage is used as an extention of RAM,
        allowing programs to run even when physical memory is limited.</div>
    <div id="answer10" class="answer" style="display: none;">Human values are principle like respect, trust, and care that behavior towards
        living harmoniously with oneself and others.</div>
    <div id="answer11" class="answer" style="display: none;">Harmony in the self means peace and clarity within thoughts and feelings, while

    <div id="answer12" class="answer" style="display: none;">Needs of the body are material and temporary like food and shelter, wherease needs 
        of the self are non-physical and continuous like happiness and respect.</div>
    <div id="answer13" class="answer" style="display: none;">An algorithm is a step-by-step method to solve a problem; a good algorithm is 
        correct, rfficient, finite,clear, and has defined input and output.</div>
    <div id="answer14" class="answer" style="display: none;">Time complexity measures how the running time of an algorithm increases with 
        input size, and space complexity measures the amount of memory used.</div>
    <div id="answer15" class="answer" style="display: none;">Divide and conquore is a strategy where a problem is broken into smaller 
        subproblems, solved individually, and then combined, as seen in algorithms like Merge Sort.</div>
